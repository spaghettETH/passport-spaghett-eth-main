# PASSPORT  

**PASSPORT** is a Proof of Attendance protocol developed by **Yomi.Digital** and **Spaghett-eth.com**.  
It empowers conference organizers to create check-ins for talks, workshops, or sessions in their schedule.  

For each check-in, QR codes are generated. These QR codes enable attendees to mint a **Passport SBT** (Soulbound Token) and update the SBT metadata with the corresponding check-in information.
